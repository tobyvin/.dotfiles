# Choose between pinentry-tty and pinentry-x11 based on whether
# $PINENTRY_USER_DATA contains USE_TTY=1
#
# Based on:
# https://kevinlocke.name/bits/2019/07/31/prefer-terminal-for-gpg-pinentry
#
# Note: Environment detection is difficult.
# - stdin is Assuan pipe, preventing tty checking
# - configuration info (e.g. ttyname) is passed via Assuan pipe, preventing
#   parsing or fallback without implementing Assuan protocol.
# - environment is sanitized by atfork_cb in call-pinentry.c (removing $GPG_TTY)
#
# $PINENTRY_USER_DATA is preserved since 2.08 https://dev.gnupg.org/T799
#
# Format of $PINENTRY_USER_DATA not specified (that I can find), pinentry-mac
# assumes comma-separated sequence of NAME=VALUE with no escaping mechanism
# https://github.com/GPGTools/pinentry-mac/blob/v0.9.4/Source/AppDelegate.m#L78
# and recognizes USE_CURSES=1 for curses fallback
